\title{Compute the gradient of the  kernel wrt X.}
\description{
  computes the gradient of the (diagonal of the) kernel matrix with respect to the elements of the design matrix given in X.
}
\usage{
  kernDiagGradX(kern, x)
  kernGradX(kern, x1, x2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{kern}{the kernel structure for which gradients are being computed.}
  \item{x}{the input data in the form of a design matrix.}
  \item{x1}{row locations against which gradients are being computed.}
  \item{x2}{column locations against which gradients are being computed.}
}
\value{
  \item{gX}{the gradients of the diagonal with respect to each element of X. The returned matrix has the same dimensions as X.}
  \item{gX2}{the returned gradients. The gradients are returned in a matrix which is numData x numInputs x numData. Where numData is the number of data points and numInputs is the number of input dimensions in X.}
